# vue-chat

Vue chat app as described by spec file. I havent used vuex store in a while so i ran out of time to implement it.
In the past years I have been using Elf and Akita stores for Angular apps so im familiar with the concept.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
